> What is mounting in vue? In vue, every instance is first stored as Virtual DOM objects(virtual html elements) in memory.When Vue create those components(virtual DOM)visible to the real DOM(Actual html elements) , the moment in which it create virtual DOM into real DOM is call 'Mounting'. As the app state changes , vue detect changes user expect to see and put data changes to the real DOM from the memory.That is called an 'update'. The entire process is called Vue Lifescyclehooks which has four stages, namely create,mount,update and destroyed.

1. vue에서는 처음 저장되는 모든 인스턴스들을 (가상 DOM 객체 - virtual DOM objects, virtual html elements) 메모리에 저장한다.
2. vue가 virtual DOM들을 real DOM(Actual html elements)들로 바꾸어주는데, 이러한 순간이 **마운팅**이다.
3. vue 인스턴스의 라이프사이클에서 등장하는 중심 단계들로는 created, Mounted, Updated, Destroyed가 있다.
